# Title: Performance benchmarking of Type II Hypervisors.

<strong>Abstract:</strong>

<p>The virtualization is carried out by the software layer called as the Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). Hypervisor is widely used in cloud datacenters. Benchmark is the measurement of best practice performance. Benchmarking is very essential term for the discovery of the best performance given by the particular system. Benchmarking can provides you the external references and the best practices on which to base your evaluations and to design your system processes which can be very useful in finding the gaps in the system to achieve the desired performance. Your target hypervisors are Virtual Box, VMWare workstation as an hosted hypervisors and KVM. Performance analysis of network, cpu, ram, I/O need to carried out..</p>

<strong>Intended Outcome:</strong>
<br/>
<p>Analyzing the performance of the different hypervisors with the similar hardware configuration and operating system. </p>
